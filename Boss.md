**Name:** Cthulhu

**concept:** this is a jrpg so we need to kill god, this is it. The boss will take the appearence of a ~~cloaked~~ Cthulhu figure with tentacles made of *godot.svg*. I found this cool asset pack of Cthulhu and we have to use it. [link](https://chierit.itch.io/free-cthulu)

The boss will alternate between 2 types of attack. He will teleport near the player and do some basic melee combo, after which the player can hit them back.

For his second attack he will teleport above the arena and perform a fullscreen attack that needs to be dodged. Kinda like Grim and his spike attack in hollow knight.

He will have a last attack when he reaches 1 HP that will be kinda bullshit like Sans' that is very hard to dodge. If they dodge it they can finish the boss off.
