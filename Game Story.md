The main character is a wizard hunter, with the main inspiration being the main character from bloodborne or Dante from devil may cry. Probably No to guns unless you really want to, but Yes to some magic powers.

He was investigating some Dark wizards for some unspecified crimes and possible ritual sacrificing. During his investigations he is captured and put in the basement of the wizard's mansion. Here the game starts

The game will likely have two (or one, depending on progress) areas. The basement and the mansion proper. The basement is classical fantasy prison like what you see in dead cells or rogue legacy. The enemies will be the wizard's minions, which are whatever free assets we can find on itch.io. The mansion proper will have more furniture and wood and portraits and stuff. Wizards will appear as elite enemies among their minions.

The first minions can be skeletons I found on [itch](https://jesse-m.itch.io/skeleton-pack)
