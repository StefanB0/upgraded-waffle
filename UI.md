# User interface

Need mechanics to decide on this one

# Main menu

The game starts with the main menu. Lobotomy corporation (and other games) have a gimmick where the game does an animation before you can see the full menu.

For our game I suggest we also do something cool but simple. The game starts off with a black screen with a flickering torch near a corner. If you hover your mouse over it, the torch lights up and lets you see the rest of the screen.

# Pause menu

## Saving:

Have a way of saving the game state.


## Questions to decide on.

1) Is the pause menu the same as the inventory menu?
2) Are we evil or not? (do you go to main menu when you press exit or do you exit the game right away)
